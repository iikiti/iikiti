iikiti is a content management system with the goal of making building webpages ranging from simple blogs to online marketplaces (e-commerce) to enterprise intranets. It uses a static structure to prevent markdown abuse that plagues modern websites and provides an easy to use block editor that makes designing, building, managing, developing and publishing pages easy. Unlike most other frameworks, iikiti's editor is on-page. This makes iikiti front-end first and allows you to see what the final page will look like without having to preview it.
